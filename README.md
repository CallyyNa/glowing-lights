# Glowing lights - Lass dir ein Licht aufgehen
While trying to practice programming, I found the idea to make a play on CSS animations and created this small website. 
The light bulbs are easy to turn on, delete, add, change color. 
Please try and enjoy :)


## Let's play

The website is available on ... for you to look at. 

## Technologies

This website was created purely with HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript. No Frameworks.

## Future implementations
- REALLY pause the lights, not interrupting the lights
- Drag and drop for the lights on a (probably) a canvas element
- Implementing of mobile version
